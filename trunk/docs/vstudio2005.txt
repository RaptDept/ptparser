Step 1 - Installing and Setting Up wxWidgets
--------------------------------------------

1) The project relies on wxWidgets for it's GUI. You must download wxWidgets
2.8.3 for Windows from http://www.wxwidgets.org/. Version 2.8.3 is the only
version guaranteed to work, so don't download any other version.

2) Once installed, you may need to setup an environmental path variable that's
required by the project, if it wasn't installed by the installer:

a) Click Start -> Control Panel -> System and Maintenance -> System ->
Advanced System Settings
b) Click Environment Variables
c) Under the System variables heading, click New
d) In the Variable name box, type WXWIN (must be capital letters)
e) In the Variable value box, enter the full path to the folder where wxWidgets
is installed. (i.e. C:\wxWidgets-2.8.3)
f) Click OK
g) Click OK
h) Click OK


Step 2 - Building wxWidgets
---------------------------

1) In the folder where you installed wxWidgets, open the build\msw folder, and
then double-click the wx.dsw file so that the project opens in Visual Studio.
When it asks to convert the project, click Yes To All.

2) Build the "Debug" and "Release" Win32 configurations. You don't need to
build the DLL or Unicode configurations, the parser project is statically
linked, and non-Unicode.

3) Set up the appropriate wxWidgets directories within Visual Studio using the
WXWIN environment variable you setup in Step 1. On the Tools menu click
Options -> Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories, and then add the
directories.

i.e. $(WXWIN)\include, $(WXWIN)\libs


Step 3 - Building Power Tab Parser
----------------------------------

1) Checkout the latest source using Subversion/TortoiseSVN:

# Non-members may check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.
svn checkout http://ptparser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptparser

2) Double-click the powertabparser.sln file in the project folder so that the
project opens in Visual Studio.

3) On the Build menu, click Batch Build.

4) Click Select All.

5) Click the Build button and wait for the build to complete.
